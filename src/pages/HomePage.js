    <h3>I'm Susy from Honolulu and these are my butterflies.</h3> 
<p>
I’ve been caring for monarchs since December 2019, when my husband gifted me a butterfly raising kit for Christmas.
</p>
<p>
This season (2022-2023) I started QR-tagging my butterflies when they are released from our lanai on Tantalus (Puʻu ʻōhiʻa).I’m hoping to learn where our butterflies go, whether the same butterflies ever come back to us, and perhaps contribute to answering the question of whether Hawaii monarchs migrate. If you’ve landed on this page, you probably found one of these tagged butterflies. Please log in (sorry, my programmer-husband says it’s necessary to keep the trolls and other internet baddies out) and leave a message about your encounter with one of these beauties!

*The name of this site “Kupulele” is a merging of the Indonesian and Hawaiian words for “butterfly” — kupu and pulelehua.
